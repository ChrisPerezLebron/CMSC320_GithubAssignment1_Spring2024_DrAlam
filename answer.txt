Why are you interested in taking CMSC320?

I am interested in learning how to clean data for processing in ML models. 
I am also interested in learning more about ML models themselves and when to
use which model. Moreover, I think learning how to visualize data would be a 
cool skill in its own right without getting into the slightly cooler ML 
implications
